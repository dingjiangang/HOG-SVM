# HOG-SVM

HOG-SVM (Histogram of Oriented Gradient - Support Vector Machine)
This work is actually my old project back to 2016. The repository provides program to detection the object using SVM classifier are using OpenCV library. Train provides the program could training using dataset and Run could detect the object using the model training of SVM.

Thanks to https://github.com/DaHoC/trainHOG , the basic HOG and SVM classifier i have taken from it.
